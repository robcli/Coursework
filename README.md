# Coursework

Scapegoat-Tree contains a scapegoat tree implemented in Java, a self-balancing binary search tree that runs amortized O(log n) insertions, deletions, and look up times. The scapegoat inherits from a simple binary search tree.

Finite-state-automata contains a finite state automata implemented in elementary js. It uses memento and state design patterns to simulate state based machines like an oven or washing machine.
